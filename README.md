# InteractiveWall
A proof of concept project where users can navigate through a list of movies using Microsoft Kinect.

The database file: Database/Gestures.gbd contains 3 gestures, namely: swipe left, siwpe right and open. The gestures are recorded with Kinect Studio v2.0 and edited with Visual Gesture Builder - Preview. Note that the swipe gestures are recorded while being seated. This shouldn't be a problem since the gesture only relates to the upperbody.
